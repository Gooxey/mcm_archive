# mcm_archive

As the name suggests, this repository is an archive of all iterations of the MCManage application.

The now-following versions are sorted from latest to oldest.

## The rust version

This iteration consisted of:

- [The mcm_proxy repo](https://github.com/Gooxey/mcm_archive/tree/mcm_proxy)
- [The mcm_misc repo](https://github.com/Gooxey/mcm_archive/tree/mcm_misc)
- [The mcm_client repo](https://github.com/Gooxey/mcm_archive/tree/mcm_client)
- The mcm_runner repo, which this time was still just a plan, therefore it did not contain anything and was not archived.
- The MCManage repo, which just contained [this readme file](./rust.md) and a [GPL-3.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

For more information on the repos, see either [this readme file](./rust.md) or, in the case of the mcm_misc library, [its readme file](https://github.com/Gooxey/mcm_archive/tree/mcm_misc/README.md).
